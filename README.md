# Cure-Mind-Project
project for detecting breast cancer using machine learning methods including Random Forest, XG boost, Logistic Regression, and KNN 

Our group project focuses on developing a robust and accurate breast cancer detection system using various machine learning techniques, all coded in Python. We apply Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), XGBoost, and K-Means Clustering to analyze and classify medical data. To ensure the quality of our data, we use multivariate techniques, such as the Mahalanobis distance, to detect outliers.

To evaluate the performance of our models, we employ metrics such as F1 score, precision, and recall, complemented by confusion matrices to provide a clear graphical representation of classification accuracy. Our models are thoroughly analyzed, compared, visualized, and summarized to highlight their effectiveness.

Additionally, we have developed and deployed an application for easy access and usage, making our system accessible to a broader audience. A comprehensive report documenting our findings has been created, ensuring that our work is well-documented and can serve as a valuable resource for future research and development
